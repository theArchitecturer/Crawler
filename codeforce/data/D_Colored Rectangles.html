<p>You are given three multisets of pairs of colored sticks: </p>
<p>You are constructing rectangles from these pairs of sticks with       the following process: </p>
<p>Thus, you get such rectangles that their opposite sides are the       same color and their adjacent sides are not the same color.</p>
<p>Each pair of sticks can be used at most once, some pairs can be       left unused. You are not allowed to split a pair into independent sticks.</p>
<p>What is the maximum area you can achieve?</p>
<p>The first line contains three integers $$R$$, $$G$$, $$B$$       ($$1 \le R, G, B \le 200$$) — the number of pairs of red sticks,       the number of pairs of green sticks and the number of pairs of       blue sticks.</p>
<p>The second line contains $$R$$ integers $$r_1, r_2, \dots,       r_R$$ ($$1 \le r_i \le 2000$$) — the lengths of sticks in each       pair of red sticks.</p>
<p>The third line contains $$G$$ integers $$g_1, g_2, \dots,       g_G$$ ($$1 \le g_i \le 2000$$) — the lengths of sticks in each       pair of green sticks.</p>
<p>The fourth line contains $$B$$ integers $$b_1, b_2, \dots,       b_B$$ ($$1 \le b_i \le 2000$$) — the lengths of sticks in each       pair of blue sticks.</p>
<p>Print the maximum possible total area of the constructed rectangles.</p>
<p>In the first example you can construct one of these rectangles:       red and green with sides $$3$$ and $$5$$, red and blue with       sides $$3$$ and $$4$$ and green and blue with sides $$5$$       and $$4$$. The best area of them is $$4 \times 5 = 20$$.</p>
<p>In the second example the best rectangles are: red/blue $$9       \times 8$$, red/blue $$5 \times 5$$, green/blue $$2 \times       1$$. So the total area is $$72 + 25 + 2 = 99$$.</p>
<p>In the third example the best rectangles are: red/green $$19       \times 8$$ and red/blue $$20 \times 11$$. The total area is       $$152 + 220 = 372$$. Note that you can't construct more       rectangles because you are not allowed to have both pairs taken to       be the same color.</p>
