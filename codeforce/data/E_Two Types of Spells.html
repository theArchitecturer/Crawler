<p>Polycarp plays a computer game (yet again). In this game, he       fights monsters using magic spells.</p>
<p>There are two types of spells: </p>
<p> spell of power $$x$$ deals       $$x$$ damage to the monster, and </p>
<p> spell of power $$y$$       deals $$y$$ damage to the monster and </p>
<p> the damage of the next       spell Polycarp casts. Each spell can be cast </p>
<p>, but       Polycarp can cast them in any order.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that Polycarp knows three spells: a fire       spell of power $$5$$, a lightning spell of power $$1$$, and a       lightning spell of power $$8$$. There are $$6$$ ways to choose       the order in which he casts the spells:</p>
<p>Initially, Polycarp knows $$0$$ spells. His spell set changes       $$n$$ times, each time he either learns a new spell or forgets       an already known one. After each change, calculate the maximum       possible damage Polycarp may deal using the spells he knows.</p>
<p>The first line contains one integer $$n$$ ($$1 \le n \le 2       \cdot 10^5$$) — the number of changes to the spell set.</p>
<p>Each of the next $$n$$ lines contains two integers $$tp$$ and       $$d$$ ($$0 \le tp_i \le 1$$; $$-10^9 \le d \le 10^9$$;       $$d_i \neq 0$$) — the description of the change. If $$tp_i$$       if equal to $$0$$, then Polycarp learns (or forgets) a fire       spell, otherwise he learns (or forgets) a lightning spell.</p>
<p>If $$d_i > 0$$, then Polycarp learns a spell of power       $$d_i$$. Otherwise, Polycarp forgets a spell with power       $$-d_i$$, and it is guaranteed that he knew that spell before       the change.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the powers of all spells Polycarp knows       after each change are different (Polycarp never knows two spells       with the same power).</p>
<p>After each change, print the maximum damage Polycarp can deal       with his current set of spells.</p>
