<p>Alice and Bob play a game. The game consists of several sets, and       each set consists of several rounds. Each round is won either by       Alice or by Bob, and the set ends when one of the players has won       $$x$$ rounds in a row. For example, if Bob won five rounds in a       row and $$x = 2$$, then two sets ends.</p>
<p>You know that Alice and Bob have already played $$n$$ rounds,       and you know the results of some rounds. For each $$x$$ from       $$1$$ to $$n$$, calculate the maximum possible number of sets       that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of       the players wins $$x$$ rounds in a row. It is possible that the       last set is still not finished — in that case, you should not       count it in the answer.</p>
<p>The first line contains one integer $$n$$ ($$1 \le n \le       10^6$$) — the number of rounds.</p>
<p>The second line contains one string $$s$$ of length $$n$$ —       the descriptions of rounds. If the $$i$$-th element of the       string is </p>
<p>, then Alice won       the $$i$$-th round; if it is </p>
<p>, then Bob won the $$i$$-th       round, and if it is </p>
<p>, then       you don't know who won the $$i$$-th round.</p>
<p>In the only line print $$n$$ integers. The $$i$$-th integer       should be equal to the maximum possible number of sets that could       have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players       wins $$i$$ rounds in a row.</p>
<p>Let's consider the first test case:</p>
