<p>A running competition is going to be held soon. The stadium where       the competition will be held can be represented by several       segments on the coordinate plane:</p>
<p>For example, here is a picture of the stadium with $$x = 10$$,       $$y = 5$$, $$n = 3$$ and $$a = [0, 3, 5, 10]$$:</p>
<p>A </p>
<p> is a route that goes       along the segments, starts and finishes at the same point, and       never intersects itself (the only two points of a lap that       coincide are its starting point and ending point). The length of a       lap is a total distance travelled around it. For example, the red       route in the picture representing the stadium is a lap of length $$24$$.</p>
<p>The competition will be held in $$q$$ stages. The $$i$$-th       stage has length $$l_i$$, and the organizers want to choose a       lap for each stage such that the length of the lap is a </p>
<p>. The       organizers don't want to choose short laps for the stages, so for       each stage, they want to find the maximum possible length of a       suitable lap.</p>
<p>Help the organizers to calculate the maximum possible lengths of       the laps for the stages! In other words, for every $$l_i$$, find       the maximum possible integer $$L$$ such that $$l_i \bmod L =       0$$, and there exists a lap of length </p>
<p> $$L$$.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to choose such a lap then print $$-1$$.</p>
<p>The first line contains three integers $$n$$, $$x$$ and       $$y$$ ($$1 \le n, x, y \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$, $$n \le x$$).</p>
<p>The second line contains $$n + 1$$ integers $$a_0$$,       $$a_1$$, ..., $$a_n$$ ($$0 = a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \dots       < a_{n - 1} < a_n = x$$).</p>
<p>The third line contains one integer $$q$$ ($$1 \le q \le 2       \cdot 10^5$$) — the number of stages.</p>
<p>The fourth line contains $$q$$ </p>
<p> integers $$l_1$$,       $$l_2$$, ..., $$l_q$$ ($$4 \le l_i \le 10^6$$) — the lengths       of the stages. </p>
<p>Print $$q$$ numbers. The $$i$$-th number should be equal to       the maximum possible length of a suitable lap for the $$i$$-th       stage, or $$-1$$ if it is impossible to choose a lap for that stage.</p>
