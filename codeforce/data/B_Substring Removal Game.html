<p>Alice and Bob play a game. They have a binary string $$s$$ (a       string such that each character in it is either $$0$$ or       $$1$$). Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice again, and so on.</p>
<p>During their move, the player can choose any number (not less       than one) of </p>
<p> in $$s$$ and delete them.</p>
<p>For example, if the string is $$10110$$, there are $$6$$       possible moves (deleted characters are bold):</p>
<p>After the characters are removed, the characters to the left and       to the right of the removed block become adjacent. I. e. the       following sequence of moves is valid: $$10\textbf{11}0 \to       1\textbf{00} \to 1$$.</p>
<p>The game ends when the string becomes empty, and the score of       each player is </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Each player wants to maximize their score. Calculate the       resulting score of Alice.</p>
<p>The first line contains one integer $$T$$ ($$1 \le T \le       500$$) — the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case contains exactly one line containing a binary       string $$s$$ ($$1 \le |s| \le 100$$).</p>
<p>For each test case, print one integer — the resulting score of       Alice (the number of $$1$$-characters deleted by her).</p>
<p>Questions about the optimal strategy will be ignored.</p>
